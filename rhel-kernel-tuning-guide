1. System Configuration for Real-Time Performance
Install Real-Time Kernel
Use the kernel-rt package to enable the real-time kernel:


# bash
Copy code
sudo yum install kernel-rt
```
Boot into the real-time kernel using the GRUB menu.

Isolate CPU Cores
Reserve specific CPU cores for real-time tasks by isolating them. Add the following kernel parameter to the bootloader:

bash
Copy code
isolcpus=<cpu_list>
Example: isolcpus=1,2.

Disable Power Management Features
Disable power-saving states and frequency scaling:

Add kernel boot parameters:
bash
Copy code
intel_idle.max_cstate=0 processor.max_cstate=1 idle=poll
Use cpupower to set the CPU governor to performance:
bash
Copy code
sudo cpupower frequency-set -g performance
2. Memory Management Tuning
Lock Memory for Real-Time Processes
Prevent memory paging using the mlockall() system call. Configure limits in /etc/security/limits.conf:

php
Copy code
<user>  -  memlock  unlimited
Reduce Swapping
Set swappiness to 0 to avoid swapping:

bash
Copy code
sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=0
NUMA Balancing
Disable automatic NUMA balancing to prevent CPU migration:

bash
Copy code
sudo sysctl kernel.numa_balancing=0
3. IRQ and CPU Affinity
Tune IRQ Affinity
Assign IRQs to specific CPUs for better performance. Example using irqbalance:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl disable irqbalance
Manually Assign IRQs
Use irqaffinity or /proc/irq/<IRQ_NUM>/smp_affinity to assign interrupts to specific cores.

4. Networking Tuning
Reduce Latency in Network Stack

Disable GRO (Generic Receive Offload) and TSO (TCP Segmentation Offload):
bash
Copy code
sudo ethtool -K <interface> gro off tso off
Enable real-time networking stack:
bash
Copy code
sudo sysctl net.core.netdev_budget=50000
sudo sysctl net.core.netdev_budget_usecs=5000
Set CPU Affinity for Network Interfaces
Use ethtool to map network queues to isolated CPUs.

5. Filesystem and I/O Optimization
Use Real-Time I/O Scheduling
Use the deadline I/O scheduler for real-time tasks:

bash
Copy code
sudo echo "mq-deadline" > /sys/block/<device>/queue/scheduler
Avoid Journaling Overhead
Use noatime and nodiratime mount options to reduce filesystem overhead.

6. Kernel Parameters for Real-Time
Add these kernel parameters for low latency:
Copy code
nosoftlockup nmi_watchdog=0 nowatchdog
Adjust Timer Granularity
Set a high-resolution timer with:
bash
Copy code
sudo sysctl kernel.timer_migration=0
7. General Recommendations
Disable Unnecessary Services
Use systemctl to stop non-essential background services.

Use Performance Tools
Utilize tools like tuna, rt-tests, and cyclictest to measure and fine-tune latency performance.

Key Focus Areas:
Install the real-time kernel.
Isolate CPU cores and disable power-saving features.
Lock memory and disable swapping.
Optimize IRQ affinity and network tuning.
Use deadline-based I/O and minimize unnecessary processes.
