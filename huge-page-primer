What are Huge Pages?

Memory pages larger than the default 4KiB size; typically 2MiB or 1GiB.
Reduces memory fragmentation and page table size.
Address Translation & TLB

Virtual addresses are mapped to physical memory using page tables.
Page table lookups add latency unless cached in the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB).
Why Huge Pages Matter

TLB with 2MiB pages can map up to ~4GiB, vs. only ~8MiB with 4KiB pages.
Reduces TLB misses and speeds up page table lookups.
Performance Gains

Benchmarks show 4.5x faster random memory access with huge pages.
When Not to Use

Optimization depends on workloads. Benchmarking is key to validating benefits.
